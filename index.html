<p>This projects aim is to create an electronic stability control for a 1/10th scale RC car. The targetted car is a nitro-powered RC-car, but any 1/10th scale RC car is compatible with the project that has a throttle and a steering servo. This is my first public project, I have been tinkering with electronics and programming for quite some time. Detailed description of the project is in the .ino file itself. I am constantly uploading content to give as much detail as possible, so if you are interested check back every now and then. <strong>Last update: 2016-06-27</strong></p>

<p>Currently I am programming the remote control, so I can set sensitivity settings and everything from the remote. In the video attached you can get a sense of how the remote is working. I have improved the menu since the video, I will soon upload a new one, but you can get the point. I am using one rotary encoder with a button to control the menu. There will be some quick controls on the remote, for ESC on/off, and lights, one of them will serve as a 'Back' button as well. Until then, there is a 'Back to xy' menu that takes you one level up in the menu. I am almost ready with the dashboard, some fine tuning is needed though. If all this is done, I need a PCB for it and tests can begin. :) </p>

<p>This is the unit on the car:

This is the makeshift remote control I made for the tests:
