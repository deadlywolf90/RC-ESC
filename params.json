  "body": "### Welcome to the RC-ESC project\r\nThis projects aim is to create an electronic stability control for a 1/10th scale RC car. The targetted car is a nitro-powered RC-car, but any 1/10th scale RC car is compatible with the project that has a throttle and a steering servo. This is my first public project, I have been tinkering with electronics and programming for quite some time. Detailed description of the project is in the .ino file itself. I am constantly uploading content to give as much detail as possible, so if you are interested check back every now and then. **Last update: 2016-06-27**\r\n\r\n### Current stage\r\nCurrently I am programming the remote control, so I can set sensitivity settings and everything from the remote. In the video attached you can get a sense of how the remote is working. I have improved the menu since the video, I will soon upload a new one, but you can get the point. I am using one rotary encoder with a button to control the menu. There will be some quick controls on the remote, for ESC on/off, and lights, one of them will serve as a 'Back' button as well. Until then, there is a 'Back to xy' menu that takes you one level up in the menu. I am almost ready with the dashboard, some fine tuning is needed though. If all this is done, I need a PCB for it and tests can begin. :) \r\n\r\n\r\n### Here is a test setup and the [link to the video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4wn0S3PNXAUS0VTdUttT1dpUEk) \r\nThis is the unit on the car:\r\n![](http://googledrive.com/host/0B4wn0S3PNXAUXzQ2TWg4LU1nUGc/testSetup.jpg)\r\nThis is the makeshift remote control I made for the tests:\r\n![](https://googledrive.com/host/0B4wn0S3PNXAUbFlYNWRQRUxRTGc)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@deadlywolf90 As of now I am the only contributor, I hope it will change as the project gets usable and workable.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nAny questions and suggestions are welcome at [gmarci90+ESC@gmail.com](mailto:gmarci90+ESC@gmail.com)",
