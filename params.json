  "body": "### Welcome to RC-ESC project\r\nThis projects aim is to create an electronic stability control for a 1/10th scale RC car. The targetted car is a nitro-powered RC-car, but any 1/10th scale RC car is compatible with the project that has a throttle and a steering servo. This is my first public project, I have been tinkering with electronics and programming for quite some time. I am constantly uploading content to give as much detail as possible, so if you are interested check back every now and then. **Last update: 2016-03-26**\r\n\r\n### Here is a test setup\r\n![](http://googledrive.com/host/0B4wn0S3PNXAUXzQ2TWg4LU1nUGc/testSetup.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@deadlywolf90 As of now I am the only contributor, I hope it will change as the project gets usable and workable.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nAny questions and suggestions are welcome at [gmarci90+ESC@gmail.com](mailto:gmarci90+ESC@gmail.com)\r\n",
